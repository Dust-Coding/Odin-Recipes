            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="list">In 1954, what was then called the Food News Department of The New York Times released a 
                pamphlet simply called “Soups,” which had 20 recipes for soups. This updated the recipe 
                adding sherry and wine to layer in more flavors. The bulk of the time is spent on 
                caramelizing the onions, a process that always takes longer than it seems it should. 
                But its worth the wait.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="liststep">
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and 
                    ½ teaspoon salt, stir and cover, letting onions soften for 5 minutes. 
                    Remove lid and let onions caramelize until golden brown over medium heat, 
                    stirring occasionally. Adjust heat if onions are browning too quickly. The
                     caramelization process may take 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
                <li>Once onions are caramelized, add wine and sherry to the pot and allow mixture
                     to come to boil. Stir in flour and let thicken for a minute or two.</li>
                <li>Slowly add warm broth, ¼ teaspoon salt and the pepper to the onion mixture 
                    and boil uncovered for 10 minutes. Add more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Heat the broiler, and arrange individual ovenproof casseroles on a baking sheet. 
                    Ladle soup into casseroles, and cover top with bread slices. Sprinkle each casserole 
                    generously with Gruyère. Broil for a minute or two, watching carefully, until cheese 
                    melts and browns. Serve immediately.</li>
