            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat the oven to 220C</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a hot pan. Grate the onion and carrot and crush the 
                    garlic before frying together. Season with teh bay leaf, a pinch of oregano, 
                    Worcestershiresauce and a little salt and pepper. Allow the onion to soften 
                    before making a well in the centre of the pan. Place the mince int he middle
                    of the pan and stir to break it up. Add the tomato puree and allow to cook out 
                    for 30 seconds. Continue until all the meat has browned nicely. Add the wine 
                    and cook off the alchol before adding the tomatoes. Leave to simmer for a 
                    further 2-3 minutes. Finnaly add the milk, turn off the heat and set aside
                    (watch Gordon's video on how to prepare bolognaise).</li>
                <li>To make the cheese sauce, first melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the 
                    flour and using a wooden spoon, stir to form a paste. Over gentle heat add 
                    a third of the milk, whisking to prevent any lumps forming. Add the rest of 
                    the milk a third at a time, whisking as you go. Season with salt and pepper 
                    and a pinch of ground nutmeg. Allow the sauce to cook out for another
                    minute before adding the Cheddar cheese. Stir and remove from the heat 
                    (watch Gordon's video on how to make the best white sauce).</li>
                <li>Spoon half of the meat sauce into the bottom of the baking dish and place
                    pasta sheets on top (break the sheets if necessary to avoid any overlapping).
                    Next, pour in just under half of the cheese sauce, and spread evenly using a 
                    spatula before spooning the remaining meat on top. Add the final layer of 
                    pasta and use the spatula to pour over the remaining cheese sauce.</li>
                <li>Finish with the grated Paramasan and sprinkle with another pinch of 
                    oregano. ADd a light seasoning of salt and pepper before cleaning the edges
                    of the dish and placing in the oven to bake for 20-25 minutes, or until folden
                    brown.</li>
                <li>In the bottom of your sald bowl use a fork to whisk together the mustard, 
                    vinegar and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Carefully open the head of 
                    lettuce, season inside with salt and pepper. upend the lettuce headfirst into 
                    the salad bowl. Hodling the root, wipe the leaes around tehbowl to coat in 
                    the vinaigrette. Twist the root and pull it out. Turn the dressed head of 
                    lettuce onto a large plate and gently open out.</li>
                <li>Portion out the lasagne and serve alongside the salad.</li>
